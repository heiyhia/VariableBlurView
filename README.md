### Installation

Just drag [`VariableBlurView.swift`](https://github.com/aheze/VariableBlurView/blob/main/Sources/VariableBlurView.swift) into your project. Or, add the package URL:

```

```

### How is it App Store upload-safe?

Well it still uses the `CAFilter` private API, but I obfuscated it as a base64 string. I've used this method in [Midnight](https://midnight.day) and it worked just fine.

Also, this version gets past App Review â€” Janum's original version included a objc briding header, which gets auto-rejected. This version uses a bunch of runtime objc selectors instead.

However, it's still possible that Apple detects this, so use at your own risk.
